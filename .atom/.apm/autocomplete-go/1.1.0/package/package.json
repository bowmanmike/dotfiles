You have a few options to ensure you always get up-to-date suggestions:\n\n* Always run `go install ./...` in your package when you make a change\n* Run `gocode set autobuild true` to have `gocode` attempt to run `go install ./...` for you\n* Configure a package (like [build](https://atom.io/packages/build)) to run your build command on every save\n\n### Configuration\n\n* `scopeBlacklist`: Suggestions will not be shown when the cursor is inside the specified comma-delimited scope(s) (default: `.source.go .comment`)\n* `suppressBuiltinAutocompleteProvider`: Suppress the provider built-in to the autocomplete-plus package when editing .go files (default: `true`)\n* `suppressActivationForCharacters`: Suggestions will not be provided when you type one of the specified characters (default: ``comma, newline, space, tab, /, \\, (, ), \", ', :,\n;, <, >, ~, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, |, +,\n=, [, ], {, }, `, ~, ?, -``)\n* `snippetMode`: Snippets can be generated when inserting the suggestion for a `func`; this option allows you to control what is generated (default: `name`)\n  * `name`: E.g.: `fmt.Println(a)` with `a` selected such that it will be replaced on the first keystroke\n  * `nameAndType`: E.g.: `fmt.Println(a ...interface{})`, with `a ...interface{}` selected such that it will be replaced on the first keystroke\n  * `none`: E.g.: `fmt.Println()`, with the cursor placed between the parenthesis\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"autocomplete-go@1.1.0","_shasum":"4a1d0ad506f287b58b62974bd4d5745ac8719e1e","_resolved":"file:../d-116513-26365-1o4r3y7/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116513-26365-1o4r3y7/package.tgz"}
