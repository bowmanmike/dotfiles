It depends on the following packages:\n\n* [`go-config`](https://atom.io/packages/go-config)\n\n## How Are The Builds Performed?\n\nThe following commands are run for the directory of the current file:\n* `go install .` (for normal `.go` files)\n* `go test -o {tmpdir} -c .` (for `_test.go` files)\n\n## Why Are You Running `go install` Instead Of `go build`?\n\n`gocode` (and a few other tools, like `gotype`) work on `.a` files (i.e. the package object archive), and the way to keep these up to date is to run `go install` periodically. This ensures your autocomplete suggestions are kept up to date without having to resort to `gocode set autobuild true` :tada:.\n\n## But What About `gb`?\n\nI'm open to suggestions for detecting a package which is built with gb; please feel free to submit a pull request that detects a gb package without any explicit configuration and runs it.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"builder-go@1.0.0","_shasum":"620a03128aa7ca3cf48f0e3220b8438336c19fd6","_resolved":"file:../d-116513-26365-2b0rra/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116513-26365-2b0rra/package.tgz"}
